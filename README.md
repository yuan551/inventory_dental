# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Firebase configuration

Firebase Auth and Firestore are initialized in `src/firebase.js`.

Currently, the Firebase config is hardcoded (by request). If you later want to hide credentials, switch to a Vite `.env` approach with `VITE_`-prefixed keys and keep `.env` out of git.
